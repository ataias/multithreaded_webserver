#+TITLE: Multi-threaded WebServer

This project followed the guidelines of the [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/2018-edition/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html][2018 Rust Book]] to develop a
multithreaded webserver. It just serves two endpoints:
- GET /
- GET /sleep
- Other requests requests 404 with an error page

The second endpoint sleeps for 5 seconds, but the user can still open pages and
the requests will be successful, with the caveat that there are only 4 threads.
